# Scamper

A mini-Scheme implementation designed for teaching, targeting multimedia applications on the web.

## Development

To run a local instance of Scamper for development purposes:

~~~console
$> npm install    # Install NPM dependencies
$> npm run dev    # Spawns a local vite server to serve the application
~~~

Follow the terminal instructions to connect to your local Scamper instance.

## Deployment

The deployment script builds Scamper and copies it to `<server>:<root>/<version>` and adds `<server>:<root>/index.html` which redirects to this latest version.
The deployment script also requires that you are on Mac/Linux and the `compsci` host points to the correct web server.

~~~console
$> npm run deploy   # Deploys Scamper
~~~

## Information about the Visualizations

The pencil button uses the tracing function of the IDE to create HTML elements of each data structure as the code declares them. The draw() function in sem.ts is the
majority of the computatons for the drawings, and following the implementation can allow one to find the functions for drawing each data structure.
The complexity of running through the elements in an environment ( Env class in lang.ts inside function toString2() ) come from the behavior where structs are called.
The compiler creates a nested environment with a parent environment to mimic control flow.
