# Scamper

A mini-Scheme implementation designed for teaching, targeting
multimedia applications on the web.

## Development

To Run Scamper in its basic test environment:

~~~console
$> npm run build              # builds Scamper
$> python3 -m http.server     # spawns a webserver rooted in this project
~~~

By default, you can then navigate to `localhost:8000/web` to interact
with the test environment.
